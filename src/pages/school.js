            Currently I am studying at Rutgers University - New Brunswick pursing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I choose to go to Rutgers University because the reputation the college has in computer science. Currently, Rutgers University is ranked higher in Computer Science than both New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and Stevens Institute of Technology. Rutgers Computer Science program has many assets like assisting students in furthering their career and getting a job in the future. Rutgersâ€™ Computer Science program has taught me a lot about being a Computer Scientist outside just the application of Computer Science. Like, the application, theory and ethics behind Computer Science. Hence, I felt this was the best college to further my career in Computer Science.

            Here are the most relevant courses I have taken at Rutgers University is:
            <ul>
                <li>Data Structures - Where I learned the main data structures utilized in everyday applications and learned how to analyze them by their run-time and space complexity.</li>
                <li>Computer Architecture - Where I learned about the fundamental issues in the design of the modern computer.</li>
                <li>Principles of Information and Data Management - Where I learned about the process of building a Database from the conceptual design to the physical design of a database.</li>
                <li>Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Where I am learning how to design efficient algorithms and how to analyze algorithms based on their Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega run-time to determine efficient algorithms.</li>
                <li>Software Methodology - Where I am learning the design process in making applications and the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming.</li>
                <li>Systems Programming - Where I am learning about writing lower-level programs that interact directly with the computer's operating system and hardware.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Here are some extra-curriculars activities I have participated in:
            <ul>
                <li>Rutgers IEEE Vex U Division</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is Rutgers IEEE?: Rutgers IEEE, which if part of the larger IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), where its split into many divisions (Robotics, ML/AI, Electronics and Novice2Expert) in which students can join one of the divisions of their interest.</li>
                    <li>What is Vex U?: Vex U is a competition held by the company Vex where universities all over the world participate to compete in a specific game set by Vex that the student teams have to create two robots to complete the game. Building the robot involves students to make the physical design and software of the robot.</li>
                    <li>Role: Programming Lead</li>
                    <li>Impact: As the division's programming lead I am responsible to teach any new coming students the fundamentals of programming the Vex Robots and teach them the ins and outs of creating the software of the robot.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
